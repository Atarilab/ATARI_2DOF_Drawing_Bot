# MIRMI_2DOF_Drawing_Bot
 
This respository contains all the CAD files, firmware and API to build an use the 2 DOF drawing robot by MIRMI lab.

# API
Use the API to interface with the drawing robot system:

## Includes
First of, import the api and the predefined shapes via:
```
from drawing_bot_api import Drawing_bot
from drawing_bot_api import shapes
```

## Intialisation
To communication with the robot you need to create an instance of Drawing_bot class:
```
drawing_bot = Drawing_bot() # Creates an instance with default parameters
```
Parameters:
- unit: Changes the unit used to describe the robots position within the working area (default: 'mm') \
  options:
  * millimeter: 'mm'
  * centimeter: 'cm'
  * meter: 'm'
- speed: Changs the speed at which the drawing robot runs in unit/sec (default: 200)

```
# example
drawing_bot = Drawing_bot(unit='m', speed=400)
```

## Add shapes or move
To create a program sequence you add shapes to your instance of the Drawing_bot class.
```
# example (in millimeters)
drawing_bot.add_shape(shapes.Line([20, 80], [40, 120]))
```

### Point

### Line
To draw a line use `shapes.Line(start_point, end_point)Â´
Parameters:
- start_point: Defines where the line should start
- end_point: Defines where the line should end
```
# example (in millimeters)
shapes.Line([20, 80], [40, 120])
```

### Circle
To draw a circle use `shapes.Circle(center_point, radius)
Parameters:
- center_point: Defines the center of the circle
- radius: Defines the radius of the circle
```
# example (in millimeters)
shapes.Circle([0, 100], 20)
```

### Partial Circle
To draw a circle that's not fully completed use `shapes.Partial_circle(start_point, end_point, radius, direction)
Parameters:
- start_point: Defines the start point of the partial circle
- end_point: Defines the end point of the partial circle
- radius: Defines the radius of the partial circle
- direction: Defines wether the partial circle should be drawn clockwise (`direction=1`) or anti-clockwise (`direction=-1`)
optional:
- big_angle: Defines whether the smaller (`big_angle=False`) or bigger (`big_angle=True`) part of the partial circle is drawn
```
# example (in millimeters9
shapes.Partial_circle([-30, 100], [30, 100], 40, 1, big_angle=True)
```
